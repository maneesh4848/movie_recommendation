The three main directories are:
(1) Code/pre_process_and_ratings/
(2) Code/demo_similar_reccomend/
(3) Code/Genre Classification/
Each directory above contains a README.txt describing what the files within that directory are responsible for.

Below are the locations of the main components of our project:

(1) Data pre-processing 			  	./Code/pre_process_and_ratings/pre-processing/
(2) Data visualization + model Demo application 	./Code/demo_similar_reccomend/app.py
(3) Rating prediction from reviews			./Code/pre_process_and_ratings/
(4) Finding similar movies from plots		./Code/demo_similar_reccomend/improved_clustering.py
(5) Predicting movie genre				./Code/Genre Classification/
(6) Movie Recommendation System			./Code/demo_similar_reccomend/movie_reccomendation.py
